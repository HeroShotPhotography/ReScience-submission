What's the best colour to wear for headshots?

Colour can make a big difference to your headshot and is a huge topic in itself.

Plain colours are generally your best choice as a first option.

Consider wearing colours that you get a lot of compliments in (there’s normally a reason for this!)

Anything that matches your eye colour is always a bonus as it will help draw attention to your eyes.

If you are a business owner or a brand ambassador, wearing a flash of your brand colour can be done subtly through an accessory like a tie or belt, lipstick or eye shadow.

For a bolder connection, consider a top or jacket of the same colour.

Subtle flashes tend to work best in our experience, giving more versatility to an image and can tie in nicely with your logo when featured on your website.

Rich colours along with gemstone colours (sapphire / ruby / emerald) typically work well on all complexions.

Pastels along with patterns are generally best avoided for photography although there are sometimes exceptions.
