Tie or No Tie?

A successful headshot is highly tailored to your ideal job, client, interviewer or audience.

Would you be wearing a tie when meeting these people in person for the first time?

There’s been a notable shift in the last 10 years across all of marketing that has put a much greater emphasis on being relatable and being authentic.

The perception that that a tie will make you appear to be more credible is simply not true. Poor quality image, bad posture, creased clothing, bad lighting and the overall quality of your portrait will all have a much greater impact on your credibility.

Whilst we are seeing industries moving away from the tie, there are some that still expect it; finance and law being the most notable of these.

After considering this, you probably will instinctively know if you need to wear a tie or not.

In most cases these days, it's a no, a shirt and jacket combination has become the business attire of choice for most professionals.

If you are still unsure, bring your tie and we can take some shots with and without it. You may find there’s a practical place for both.
